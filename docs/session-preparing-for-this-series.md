<br><br><br>

## The Goal of this Series

- **The primary goal is to enable you to learn and implement hands-on AI solutions yourself**

  - **The Hands-on nature, IMO, enables you to truly learn AI**
    - "Hands-on" means you can execute the lesson samples yourself, and start to comprehend the code
    - Humans learn by doing, not just by listening
  - Goal is **100-level** - not 200, 300, or 400 level
  - To put you in a better position to learn AI, as it rapidly evolves
  - To put you in a better position to serve our customers

### Secondary Goals

In order to achieve the above primary goal, we will, in this sequence:

- Introduce you to **Application Development with Git, GitHub, and Python**
  - At a minimum, have you "git clone" this GitHub repository for your use in this series
- Introduce you to the most relevant **Azure PaaS Services for AI Applications**
  - Storage, Foundry (LLMs), OpenAI, Cosmos DB, Search
- Introduce you to **AI concepts and technologies**
  - Document Intelligence, Knowledge Graphs, MCP, Agent Framework, Prompting, RAG, Vector Search, etc.
- Provide **working code** to jump-start your personal learning journey

### Are we going to cover everything you need to know about AI?

- No.  But we'll cover enough to jump-start your personal learning journey

### Is the series customized for me and my unique needs?

- No.  Obviously not, but the goal is to appeal to a broad audience wanting guidance and direction in their AI journey.

## My Goal

- Is to **"Teach you to Fish"** in these ~20 **bite-size** lessons/sessions
- Provide you with an understanding of the core concepts and technologies
- Provide you with a working codebase to jump-start your personal learning journey
- To encourage, coach, and guide you
  - But not teach you the details of each topic - my time is finite

<br><br><br>

## Why Python?

- Python is the most popular programming language in the world
  - Per the [TIOBE Index](https://www.tiobe.com/tiobe-index/)
- **Python is the most popular language for AI**
- Python is relatively easy to learn and use
- Python has a very broad range of use-cases 
  - AI/ML
  - Web Services and Apps
  - Data Science
  - System Administration
  - Ad-hoc scripting
  - Many others...
- **Microsoft has a broad range of Python SDKs for Azure services**
  - SDK = Software Development Kit
  - See [Microsoft Azure SDK for Python](https://github.com/Azure/azure-sdk-for-python)
    - This is a large **monorepo** for their many SDKs

### Why did I volunteer to create and present this series?

- I've seen a great need, at Microsoft, for technical enablement amongst my peers
- **I'm seeing the same need at 3Cloud, especially as AI is transforming us so rapidly**
- **Hands-on enablement in Python and AI can unleash your understanding, skills, value, success**
- To put us in a better position to understand and serve our customers

<br><br><br>

## Each Session

- Will be a **"Bite-size"** 30-minute Teams meeting to cover one topic
  - First five minutes is for Q&A from previous Session
  - Next 15-20 minutes is for presentation and demonstration (please be on mute)
    - Post your questions in the Teams meeting chat
  - Last 5-10 minutes is for questions and discussion
- **Sessions will be recorded** for your reference

<br><br><br>

<br><br><br>

## Series Content - GitHub, Teams Meetings, Teams Channel

- All content will be in GitHub, for your reference
  - [Series GitHub Repository](https://github.com/3cloud-dev/zero-to-AI-private)  
- **Primarily markdown content** (like this page) - one page per topic
- **The simplest-possible Python code** to demonstrate the topic
- **Curated lists of hyperlinks to external content** for your reference
- No flashy PowerPoint presentations

<br><br><br>
---
<br><br><br>

## Let's build a Learning Community in Teams

- **Help each other.  Learn from each other**
- I'll monitor the Teams channel, but my time for one-on-one conversations is limited
- I'd like to see leaders emerge in this channel, to help the others

<br><br><br>
---
<br><br><br>

## Azure

- **You won't use Azure Portal in this series**
- **You don't have to provision Azure resources**
- I'll share **read-only keys to Azure resources** instead (in a 3Cloud Subscription)
- This will enable you to focus on learning, not provisioning and DevOps
- But please learn in another Azure Subscription if you wish to

### Personal Azure Accounts 

- I encourage you to create one for your ongoing educational use
- [Create a Personal Azure Account](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/pricing/purchase-options/azure-account/search)
- [Free Services](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/pricing/purchase-options/azure-account/search#Free-products)
- [Cost Management](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/cost-management-billing/manage/spending-limit)
  - I've configured my personal account to have a spending limit of $20 per month

<br><br><br>

<br><br><br>

## Homework

- **Execute the lesson samples yourself, and look at the code**
- All code in this series can be executed from your laptop
- Visit the referenced hyperlinks in each lesson

<br><br><br>
---
<br><br><br>

## Expectation/Hope

- The hardest sessions will be the first two on installing git, python, uv
- Get a working git, python, uv, and cloned repository on your laptop ASAP
- Please stay engaged, don't drop out if you feel you're falling behind
  - There will be time to catch up!
- **Execute the lesson samples yourself, and look at the code**
- Be curious, lean forward, engage, learn
- Help each other learn.  Form your own small study groups if you'd like to
- **Please don't stress about not understanding everything at first.  You will, in time.**
  - You will learn at your own pace, and in your own way, after this series.

## Out of Scope for this Series

- Microsoft Fabric
- Databricks (but Jupyter and Notebooks are covered)
- Provisioning Azure resources
- DevOps
- LangChain and Semantic Kernel
  - The focus is on the new Microsoft Agent Framework
- Other programming languages - C#, Java, TypeScript, etc.
- Architecture and Design
  - The focus in this series is on the system **Building-Blocks**, not designing entire applications

## In Summary, the Goal is to **"Teach you to Fish" regarding AI, with Python**
