# Part 1, Session 1 - Git and GitHub


## Description

- Git is a distributed and modern Source Control System (DSCM)
- It creates versions of each file, with incremental changes
- Git was created by Linus Torvalds for the development of Linux
- GitHub is a cloud-based PaaS (platform as a service) for Git
- Git can be used locally on your workstation without GitHub
- The .gitignore file - some files/paths shouldn't be stored in git
- Branches - main and features
- Pull Requests (i.e. - PRs) - Peer requests to review and merge feature branch into the main branch
