While the SDK provides core functionality, FastMCP 2.0 delivers everything needed for production: advanced MCP patterns (server composition, proxying, OpenAPI/FastAPI generation, tool transformation), enterprise auth (Google, GitHub, WorkOS, Azure, Auth0, and more), deployment tools, testing utilities, and comprehensive client libraries.\n>\n> **For production MCP applications, install FastMCP:** `pip install fastmcp`\n\n> [!Important]\n> FastMCP 3.0 is in development and may include breaking changes. To avoid unexpected issues, pin your dependency to v2: `fastmcp<3`\n\n---\n\n**FastMCP is the standard framework for building MCP applications**, providing the fastest path from idea to production.\n\nThe [Model Context Protocol (MCP)](https://modelcontextprotocol.io) is a standardized way to provide context and tools to LLMs. FastMCP makes building production-ready MCP servers simple, with enterprise auth, deployment tools, and a complete ecosystem built in.\n\n```python\n# server.py\nfrom fastmcp import FastMCP\n\nmcp = FastMCP(\"Demo 🚀\")\n\n@mcp.tool\ndef add(a: int, b: int) -> int:\n    \"\"\"Add two numbers\"\"\"\n    return a + b\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    mcp.run()\n```\n\nRun the server locally:\n\n```bash\nfastmcp run server.py\n```\n\n### 📚 Documentation\n\nFastMCP's complete documentation is available at **[gofastmcp.com](https://gofastmcp.com)**, including detailed guides, API references, and advanced patterns. This readme provides only a high-level overview.\n\nDocumentation is also available in [llms.txt format](https://llmstxt.org/), which is a simple markdown standard that LLMs can consume easily.\n\nThere are two ways to access the LLM-friendly documentation:\n\n- [`llms.txt`](https://gofastmcp.com/llms.txt) is essentially a sitemap, listing all the pages in the documentation.\n- [`llms-full.txt`](https://gofastmcp.com/llms-full.txt) contains the entire documentation. Note this may exceed the context window of your LLM.\n\n**Community:** Join our [Discord server](https://discord.gg/uu8dJCgttd) to connect with other FastMCP developers and share what you're building.\n\n---\n\n<!-- omit in toc -->\n## Table of Contents\n\n- [FastMCP v2 🚀](#fastmcp-v2-)\n  - [📚 Documentation](#-documentation)\n  - [What is MCP?](#what-is-mcp)\n  - [Why FastMCP?](#why-fastmcp)\n  - [Installation](#installation)\n  - [Core Concepts](#core-concepts)\n    - [The `FastMCP` Server](#the-fastmcp-server)\n    - [Tools](#tools)\n    - [Resources \\& Templates](#resources--templates)\n    - [Prompts](#prompts)\n    - [Context](#context)\n    - [MCP Clients](#mcp-clients)\n  - [Authentication](#authentication)\n    - [Enterprise Authentication, Zero Configuration](#enterprise-authentication-zero-configuration)\n  - [Deployment](#deployment)\n    - [From Development to Production](#from-development-to-production)\n  - [Advanced Features](#advanced-features)\n    - [Proxy Servers](#proxy-servers)\n    - [Composing MCP Servers](#composing-mcp-servers)\n    - [OpenAPI \\& FastAPI Generation](#openapi--fastapi-generation)\n  - [Running Your Server](#running-your-server)\n  - [Contributing](#contributing)\n    - [Prerequisites](#prerequisites)\n    - [Setup](#setup)\n    - [Unit Tests](#unit-tests)\n    - [Static Checks](#static-checks)\n    - [Pull Requests](#pull-requests)\n\n---\n\n## What is MCP?\n\nThe [Model Context Protocol (MCP)](https://modelcontextprotocol.io) lets you build servers that expose data and functionality to LLM applications in a secure, standardized way. It is often described as \"the USB-C port for AI\", providing a uniform way to connect LLMs to resources they can use. It may be easier to think of it as an API, but specifically designed for LLM interactions. MCP servers can:\n\n- Expose data through **Resources** (think of these sort of like GET endpoints; they are used to load information into the LLM's context)\n- Provide functionality through **Tools** (sort of like POST endpoints; they are used to execute code or otherwise produce a side effect)\n- Define interaction patterns through **Prompts** (reusable templates for LLM interactions)\n- And more!\n\nFastMCP provides a high-level, Pythonic interface for building, managing, and interacting with these servers.\n\n## Why FastMCP?\n\nFastMCP handles all the complex protocol details so you can focus on building. In most cases, decorating a Python function is all you need — FastMCP handles the rest.\n\n🚀 **Fast:** High-level interface means less code and faster development\n\n🍀 **Simple:** Build MCP servers with minimal boilerplate\n\n🐍 **Pythonic:** Feels natural to Python developers\n\n🔍 **Complete:** Everything for production — enterprise auth (Google, GitHub, Azure, Auth0, WorkOS), deployment tools, testing frameworks, client libraries, and more\n\nFastMCP provides the shortest path from idea to production. Deploy locally, to the cloud with [FastMCP Cloud](https://fastmcp.cloud), or to your own infrastructure.\n\n## Installation\n\nWe recommend installing FastMCP with [uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/):\n\n```bash\nuv pip install fastmcp\n```\n\nFor full installation instructions, including verification, upgrading from the official MCPSDK, and developer setup, see the [**Installation Guide**](https://gofastmcp.com/getting-started/installation).\n\n**Dependency Licensing:** FastMCP depends on Cyclopts for CLI functionality. Cyclopts v4 includes docutils as a transitive dependency, which has complex licensing that may trigger compliance reviews in some organizations. If this is a concern, you can install Cyclopts v5 alpha (`pip install \"cyclopts>=5.0.0a1\"`) which removes this dependency, or wait for the stable v5 release. See [this issue](https://github.com/BrianPugh/cyclopts/issues/672) for details.\n\n## Core Concepts\n\nThese are the building blocks for creating MCP servers and clients with FastMCP.\n\n### The `FastMCP` Server\n\nThe central object representing your MCP application. It holds your tools, resources, and prompts, manages connections, and can be configured with settings like authentication.\n\n```python\nfrom fastmcp import FastMCP\n\n# Create a server instance\nmcp = FastMCP(name=\"MyAssistantServer\")\n```\n\nLearn more in the [**FastMCP Server Documentation**](https://gofastmcp.com/servers/server).\n\n### Tools\n\nTools allow LLMs to perform actions by executing your Python functions (sync or async). Ideal for computations, API calls, or side effects (like `POST`/`PUT`). FastMCP handles schema generation from type hints and docstrings. Tools can return various types, including text, JSON-serializable objects, and even images or audio aided by the FastMCP media helper classes.\n\n```python\n@mcp.tool\ndef multiply(a: float, b: float) -> float:\n    \"\"\"Multiplies two numbers.\"\"\"\n    return a * b\n```\n\nLearn more in the [**Tools Documentation**](https://gofastmcp.com/servers/tools).\n\n### Resources & Templates\n\nResources expose read-only data sources (like `GET` requests). Use `@mcp.resource(\"your://uri\")`. Use `{placeholders}` in the URI to create dynamic templates that accept parameters, allowing clients to request specific data subsets.\n\n```python\n# Static resource\n@mcp.resource(\"config://version\")\ndef get_version(): \n    return \"2.0.1\"\n\n# Dynamic resource template\n@mcp.resource(\"users://{user_id}/profile\")\ndef get_profile(user_id: int):\n    # Fetch profile for user_id...\n    return {\"name\": f\"User {user_id}\", \"status\": \"active\"}\n```\n\nLearn more in the [**Resources & Templates Documentation**](https://gofastmcp.com/servers/resources).\n\n### Prompts\n\nPrompts define reusable message templates to guide LLM interactions. Decorate functions with `@mcp.prompt`. Return strings or `Message` objects.\n\n```python\n@mcp.prompt\ndef summarize_request(text: str) -> str:\n    \"\"\"Generate a prompt asking for a summary.\"\"\"\n    return f\"Please summarize the following text:\\n\\n{text}\"\n```\n\nLearn more in the [**Prompts Documentation**](https://gofastmcp.com/servers/prompts).\n\n### Context\n\nAccess MCP session capabilities within your tools, resources, or prompts by adding a `ctx: Context` parameter. Context provides methods for:\n\n- **Logging:** Log messages to MCP clients with `ctx.info()`, `ctx.error()`, etc.\n- **LLM Sampling:** Use `ctx.sample()` to request completions from the client's LLM.\n- **Resource Access:** Use `ctx.read_resource()` to access resources on the server\n- **Progress Reporting:** Use `ctx.report_progress()` to report progress to the client.\n- and more...\n\nTo access the context, add a parameter annotated as `Context` to any mcp-decorated function. FastMCP will automatically inject the correct context object when the function is called.\n\n```python\nfrom fastmcp import FastMCP, Context\n\nmcp = FastMCP(\"My MCP Server\")\n\n@mcp.tool\nasync def process_data(uri: str, ctx: Context):\n    # Log a message to the client\n    await ctx.info(f\"Processing {uri}...\")\n\n    # Read a resource from the server\n    data = await ctx.read_resource(uri)\n\n    # Ask client LLM to summarize the data\n    summary = await ctx.sample(f\"Summarize: {data.content[:500]}\")\n\n    # Return the summary\n    return summary.text\n```\n\nLearn more in the [**Context Documentation**](https://gofastmcp.com/servers/context).\n\n### MCP Clients\n\nInteract with *any* MCP server programmatically using the `fastmcp.Client`. It supports various transports (Stdio, SSE, In-Memory) and often auto-detects the correct one. The client can also handle advanced patterns like server-initiated **LLM sampling requests** if you provide an appropriate handler.\n\nCritically, the client allows for efficient **in-memory testing** of your servers by connecting directly to a `FastMCP` server instance via the `FastMCPTransport`, eliminating the need for process management or network calls during tests.\n\n```python\nfrom fastmcp import Client\n\nasync def main():\n    # Connect via stdio to a local script\n    async with Client(\"my_server.py\") as client:\n        tools = await client.list_tools()\n        print(f\"Available tools: {tools}\")\n        result = await client.call_tool(\"add\", {\"a\": 5, \"b\": 3})\n        print(f\"Result: {result.content[0].text}\")\n\n    # Connect via SSE\n    async with Client(\"http://localhost:8000/sse\") as client:\n        # ... use the client\n        pass\n```\n\nTo use clients to test servers, use the following pattern:\n\n```python\nfrom fastmcp import FastMCP, Client\n\nmcp = FastMCP(\"My MCP Server\")\n\nasync def main():\n    # Connect via in-memory transport\n    async with Client(mcp) as client:\n        # ... use the client\n```\n\nFastMCP also supports connecting to multiple servers through a single unified client using the standard MCP configuration format:\n\n```python\nfrom fastmcp import Client\n\n# Standard MCP configuration with multiple servers\nconfig = {\n    \"mcpServers\": {\n        \"weather\": {\"url\": \"https://weather-api.example.com/mcp\"},\n        \"assistant\": {\"command\": \"python\", \"args\": [\"./assistant_server.py\"]}\n    }\n}\n\n# Create a client that connects to all servers\nclient = Client(config)\n\nasync def main():\n    async with client:\n        # Access tools and resources with server prefixes\n        forecast = await client.call_tool(\"weather_get_forecast\", {\"city\": \"London\"})\n        answer = await client.call_tool(\"assistant_answer_question\", {\"query\": \"What is MCP?\"})\n```\n\nLearn more in the [**Client Documentation**](https://gofastmcp.com/clients/client) and [**Transports Documentation**](https://gofastmcp.com/clients/transports).\n\n## Authentication\n\n### Enterprise Authentication, Zero Configuration\n\nFastMCP provides comprehensive authentication support that sets it apart from basic MCP implementations. Secure your servers and authenticate your clients with the same enterprise-grade providers used by major corporations.\n\n**Built-in OAuth Providers:**\n\n- **Google**\n- **GitHub**\n- **Microsoft Azure**\n- **Auth0**\n- **WorkOS**\n- **Descope**\n- **Discord**\n- **JWT/Custom**\n- **API Keys**\n\nProtecting a server takes just two lines:\n\n```python\nfrom fastmcp.server.auth.providers.google import GoogleProvider\n\nauth = GoogleProvider(client_id=\"...\", client_secret=\"...\", base_url=\"https://myserver.com\")\nmcp = FastMCP(\"Protected Server\", auth=auth)\n```\n\nConnecting to protected servers is even simpler:\n\n```python\nasync with Client(\"https://protected-server.com/mcp\", auth=\"oauth\") as client:\n    # Automatic browser-based OAuth flow\n    result = await client.call_tool(\"protected_tool\")\n```\n\n**Why FastMCP Auth Matters:**\n\n- **Production-Ready:** Persistent storage, token refresh, comprehensive error handling\n- **Zero-Config OAuth:** Just pass `auth=\"oauth\"` for automatic setup\n- **Enterprise Integration:** WorkOS SSO, Azure Active Directory, Auth0 tenants\n- **Developer Experience:** Automatic browser launch, local callback server, environment variable support\n- **Advanced Architecture:** Full OIDC support, Dynamic Client Registration (DCR), and unique OAuth proxy pattern that enables DCR with any provider\n\n*Authentication this comprehensive is unique to FastMCP 2.0.*\n\nLearn more in the **Authentication Documentation** for [servers](https://gofastmcp.com/servers/auth) and [clients](https://gofastmcp.com/clients/auth).\n\n## Deployment\n\n### From Development to Production\n\nFastMCP supports every deployment scenario from local development to global scale:\n\n**Development:** Run locally with a single command\n\n```bash\nfastmcp run server.py\n```\n\n**Production:** Deploy to [**FastMCP Cloud**](https://fastmcp.cloud) — Remote MCP that just works\n\n- Instant HTTPS endpoints\n- Built-in authentication\n- Zero configuration\n- Free for personal servers\n\n**Self-Hosted:** Use HTTP or SSE transports for your own infrastructure\n\n```python\nmcp.run(transport=\"http\", host=\"0.0.0.0\", port=8000)\n```\n\nLearn more in the [**Deployment Documentation**](https://gofastmcp.com/deployment).\n\n## Advanced Features\n\nFastMCP introduces powerful ways to structure and compose your MCP applications.\n\n### Proxy Servers\n\nCreate a FastMCP server that acts as an intermediary for another local or remote MCP server using `FastMCP.as_proxy()`. This is especially useful for bridging transports (e.g., remote SSE to local Stdio) or adding a layer of logic to a server you don't control.\n\nLearn more in the [**Proxying Documentation**](https://gofastmcp.com/patterns/proxy).\n\n### Composing MCP Servers\n\nBuild modular applications by mounting multiple `FastMCP` instances onto a parent server using `mcp.mount()` (live link) or `mcp.import_server()` (static copy).\n\nLearn more in the [**Composition Documentation**](https://gofastmcp.com/patterns/composition).\n\n### OpenAPI & FastAPI Generation\n\nAutomatically generate FastMCP servers from existing OpenAPI specifications (`FastMCP.from_openapi()`) or FastAPI applications (`FastMCP.from_fastapi()`), instantly bringing your web APIs to the MCP ecosystem.\n\nLearn more: [**OpenAPI Integration**](https://gofastmcp.com/integrations/openapi) | [**FastAPI Integration**](https://gofastmcp.com/integrations/fastapi).\n\n## Running Your Server\n\nThe main way to run a FastMCP server is by calling the `run()` method on your server instance:\n\n```python\n# server.py\nfrom fastmcp import FastMCP\n\nmcp = FastMCP(\"Demo 🚀\")\n\n@mcp.tool\ndef hello(name: str) -> str:\n    return f\"Hello, {name}!\"\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    mcp.run()  # Default: uses STDIO transport\n```\n\nFastMCP supports three transport protocols:\n\n**STDIO (Default)**: Best for local tools and command-line scripts.\n\n```python\nmcp.run(transport=\"stdio\")  # Default, so transport argument is optional\n```\n\n**Streamable HTTP**: Recommended for web deployments.\n\n```python\nmcp.run(transport=\"http\", host=\"127.0.0.1\", port=8000, path=\"/mcp\")\n```\n\n**SSE**: For compatibility with existing SSE clients.\n\n```python\nmcp.run(transport=\"sse\", host=\"127.0.0.1\", port=8000)\n```\n\nSee the [**Running Server Documentation**](https://gofastmcp.com/deployment/running-server) for more details.\n\n## Contributing\n\nContributions are the core of open source! We welcome improvements and features.\n\n### Prerequisites\n\n- Python 3.10+\n- [uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/) (Recommended for environment management)\n\n### Setup\n\n1.
